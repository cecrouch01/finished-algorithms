# Finished Algorithms

## Description

This is to be used as a way to showcase what algorithms I have been practicing to hone my craft. As a new web developer I want to show where I started and where I am at now. The smaller the number means it is an algorithm I did earlier in my career. What you will end up seeing is a progression of my skill level when I started to the skill level I am currently at. 

## Installation

Go to the link below to peruse the algorithms I have finished.
